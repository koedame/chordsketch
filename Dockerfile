# Multi-stage Dockerfile for building ChordSketch from source.
# For pre-built multi-arch images, see ghcr.io/koedame/chordsketch.

# Builder stage pinned to its sha256 manifest list digest for the same
# reason the runtime stage is below: a tag republish on Docker Hub could
# otherwise produce a tampered builder that quietly compiles malicious
# binary into the trusted runtime layer. The tag is kept alongside the
# digest so Dependabot can correlate the bump. See #1103.

# Pinned to a specific date-stamped Debian point release AND its sha256
# manifest list digest (was floating `debian:bookworm-slim`) so a tag
# republish or a future bookworm patch cannot silently change the image
# we ship. The tag is kept alongside the digest so Dependabot can
# correlate the bump and humans can read the version at a glance.
# Bump intentionally via Dependabot. See #1070, #1100.
