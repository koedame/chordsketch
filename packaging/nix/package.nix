# Reference nixpkgs derivation for chordsketch.

# This file is a template for submitting a PR to NixOS/nixpkgs.
# Place it at pkgs/by-name/ch/chordsketch/package.nix in a nixpkgs
# checkout and submit a PR.
#
# Last verified build: v0.2.0 on x86_64-linux with nixpkgs unstable.
# v0.4.0 hashes are intentionally blank (see `hash` / `cargoHash`
# below) — the release PR bumps `version` but leaves the derivation
# in its "awaiting-build" state per the workflow below.
#
# When bumping to a new release, update `version` and recompute `hash`
# and `cargoHash` by setting both to "" and building once — nix will
# report the correct SRI hashes in the error messages. After a
# successful build, update the "Last verified build" line above.
