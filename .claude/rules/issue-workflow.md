# Issue-Driven Workflow

## Issue Requirements

- Every piece of work starts with a GitHub Issue.
- Issue title: imperative mood, concise (e.g., "Implement chord directive parser").
- Issue body must include:
  - **Goal**: What should be achieved
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: Checkboxes for done-ness
  - **Phase**: Which roadmap phase this belongs to

## Issue Labels

| Category | Labels |
|---|---|
| Phase | `phase:1` through `phase:6` (roadmap phases) |
| Type | `type:feature`, `type:bug`, `type:docs`, `type:refactor`, `type:ci` |
| Size | `size:small` (< 1 hour), `size:medium` (1-4 hours), `size:large` (4+ hours) |
| Priority | `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low` |
| Status | `blocked` (waiting on another issue) |

## Workflow Lifecycle

1. Create Issue with labels.
2. Create worktree + branch from latest `main`.
3. Implement (commits reference issue: `Part of #N` or `Closes #N`).
4. Open PR (title references issue, body has `Closes #N`).
5. CI -> `/review` -> `/security-review` -> merge.
6. Cleanup worktree.
