# Pull Request Workflow

## Automated Flow (default)

PRs are reviewed automatically; **merging is always a human action**.

1. **PR created** — author opens PR with code and tests.
2. **CI runs** (cargo fmt --check, cargo clippy -- -D warnings, cargo test, plus
   workflow-specific smoke jobs).
3. **Auto-review** — on CI success, `claude-review.yml` requests a Claude review
   with severity classification. Claude performs both code review and security review.
4. **Blocking findings** (High, Medium) — Claude pushes fix commits directly.
   CI re-runs, then a **delta review** examines only the fix commits.
5. **Non-blocking findings** (Low, Nit) — Claude creates GitHub Issues. These do
   **not** block the PR from merging.
6. **Ready for human merge** — when there are no blocking findings, Claude posts a
   single summary comment stating "Ready for human merge." Bots **never** run
   `gh pr merge` in this repo. A human inspects the full check rollup (not just
   the required checks listed in branch protection) and performs the squash merge.
7. **Safety cap** — after 3 auto-review iterations, the process stops and waits for
   human intervention.

### Why bots do not merge

A previous iteration of this workflow had bots run `gh pr merge --squash --auto` after
review. This was removed after a PR was silently merged with two `README Install Smoke
Tests` jobs in FAILURE state, because those jobs were not in the
`required_status_checks.contexts` list of branch protection. `gh pr merge --auto` only
waits for *required* checks, so any check not in the explicit list is ignored. The
combination of "required-list drift" and "no human gate" produced a silent
regression in coverage. Removing bot-driven merging closes the second hole and
turns the first one into "PR sits open with red checks until a human looks."

## Manual Flow (optional)

For local review before pushing, or when the automated flow is not desired:

1. Run `/review` and/or `/security-review` locally.
2. Fix any blocking findings, then push.
3. The automated flow takes over from step 2 above.

## Rules

- All changes enter `main` via pull request — no direct pushes.
- All PRs are **squash-merged** (merge commits and rebase merging are disabled).
- Branch protection enforces that status checks pass on the HEAD commit before merging.

### Severity Definitions

| Severity | Blocks PR/Phase | Definition |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| High | Yes | Security vulnerabilities, data corruption, crashes |
| Medium | Yes | Spec violations, logic bugs, incorrect output |
| Low | No | Defense-in-depth gaps, minor inconsistencies, portability |
| Nit | No | Style, naming, test coverage suggestions |

### Delta Review

When a review produces blocking findings and fixes are applied, the subsequent review
must only examine the new commits (the fix diff), not re-review the entire PR. This
ensures convergence: fix diffs are small and produce fewer findings, trending toward
zero.

Previously-reviewed code that was not flagged is considered accepted. If a reviewer
later discovers a blocking issue in previously-accepted code, it should be filed as a
separate issue — not raised in the delta review.

### PR Formatting

- PR titles should be concise and written in imperative mood (e.g., "Add chord
  transposition support").
- PR descriptions must include What, Why, Test results, and Review summary sections.
- PR descriptions and commit messages must stay neutral and technical. The
  following are prohibited:
  - Verbatim quotes of user or reviewer messages.
  - Session dates, timestamps, or narrative framing such as
    "in the 2026-04-XX session the assistant said X and the user replied Y".
  - GitHub handles (`@user`) naming who said what. Linking an issue or PR
    number (`#1234`) is fine; naming a person's reaction is not.
  - Blow-by-blow reconstructions of how the PR came to exist.

  Write every PR body and commit message as if onboarding a future maintainer
  who has no access to the originating conversation. The change and its
  rationale stand on their own; the conversation that produced them does not.

  **Why:** PR history and commit messages are a permanent onboarding artefact
  that future maintainers and code-archaeology tools rely on. Conversational
  context rots — participants leave, quotes lose meaning, dates become
  noise — and embedding it in durable artefacts pollutes the signal. Keep
  conversations in chat, issues, or review threads; keep PR bodies and
  commit messages in the technical-record voice.
